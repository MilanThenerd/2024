# TODO:
- [ ] Game "menu" Simon
- [ ] Check abstract factory
  - [ ] deployArtillery (Artillery fixed on certain cell on map/does it move with unit?)
- [x] Draw/generate map Simon
- [ ] "AI" player (Strategy) Simon
  - [ ] TacticalCommand Simon
  - [ ] BattleStrategy: (Flanking/Fortification/Ambush) Simon
        - Different troops more likely to choose different strategy based on the terrain
        - To showcase strategies we can just have printouts or we could make the battles slightly different
  - [ ] Turns/game loop Simon
- [ ] Memento
  - [ ] Use memento to make more educated decisions for BattleStrategy (we can check if the battle was in our favor or not, choose a more/less risky approach based on unit+enemy health?)
- [ ] Composite
  - [ ] Units can join each other to form bigger legions - we can have them attack all at once, dont know how this will effect battlestrategy yet
- [ ] UML Diagrams
  - [ ] Class diagram
